                Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the development of alternating current (AC) electrical systems.
                He was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, which was then part of the Austrian Empire (now Croatia).
                Tesla gained experience in telephony and electrical engineering before immigrating to the United States in 1884 to work for Thomas Edison.
                He later established his own laboratories and companies to develop a wide range of electrical and mechanical devices.
                Tesla's inventions and ideas were far ahead of his time and have had a lasting impact on the world.
